# -gini_coefficient
This is a project in which I've created a Gini Coefficient using information about students' proficiency in math and portuguese. It was made during a summer job period in Tuneduc, now "Por A Mais B".
The data was obtained from the national exam Prova Brasil from the year of 2017 and can be downloaded from http://portal.inep.gov.br/artigo/-/asset_publisher/B4AQV9zFY7Bv/content/microdados-do-sistema-de-avaliacao-da-educacao-basica-de-2017-sao-divulgados/21206
