# -gini_coefficient
This is a project in which I've created a Gini Coefficient using information about students' proficiency in math and portuguese. It was made during a summer job period in Tuneduc, now "Por A Mais B".
The data was obtained from the national exam Prova Brasil from the year of 2017 and can be downloaded from http://portal.inep.gov.br/artigo/-/asset_publisher/B4AQV9zFY7Bv/content/microdados-do-sistema-de-avaliacao-da-educacao-basica-de-2017-sao-divulgados/21206


The work was all done using R programming and the main script is the 'Tuneduc_arrumado.R'. The other one called 'nomes_escolas.R' has to be used along side the main one in order to create a table with the name of the schools included in the analysis.

It is important to say that the this list only include schools that are located in the states to which Por A Mais B provides services for.
